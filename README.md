## Chrome "install to homescreen" boilerplate

This is a quick boilerplate I've put together, using the [guidelines available from Google]().

You'll need to make your own launcher icon at the sizes provided. At the very least, provide a 192x192 version.

You can change the `theme-color` meta tag in the HTML, this will control the title bar color for when your launcher is launched on Android 5+.
